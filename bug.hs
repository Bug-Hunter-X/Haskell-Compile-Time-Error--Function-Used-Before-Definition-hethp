This Haskell code attempts to use a function that hasn't been defined yet, leading to a compile-time error.  The error message will typically indicate that the function is not in scope.

```haskell
main = do
  let result = mysteryFunction 5
  print result

-- This function is defined *after* it is used in main.
mysteryFunction x = x * 2
```
